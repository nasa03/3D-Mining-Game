# 3D-Mining-Game

A project of mine that has been in development for a while. Inspired from the Blockland gamemode called "Unlimited Mining".
In this game, you mine ores and upgrade your stats. The deeper you go, the more valuable ores you'll encounter.

This project is still under developement.

## Additional Info

The Unstable branch is there to do big changes that might break the game completely, without screwing with the stable version.
